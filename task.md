Part 2: The Build (University Finder Module)
Objective: Build a highly optimized "Find University" page. Reference: You can look at our current page shabujglobal.com/universities for context, but do not copy it. We want to see your own improved version.

Requirements:

Tech Stack: Next.js (App Router preferred), Tailwind CSS. Backend can be Next.js API Routes or a separate Express application.

Core Data: Create a database with dummy university data (please use real university names to make it realistic) containing:

University Name

Country

Location (City/State)

Tuition Fee

Ranking

Established Year

Filtering System:

Implement filters for all the data points listed above.

Innovation: We will highly appreciate it if you come up with new/unique filter ideas that would be useful for a student looking to study abroad.

Constraint: The filtering logic must happen on the Server/Backend.

Performance & Optimization:

The page must be fast, responsive, and SEO-friendly.

We will not specify which rendering methods of optimization techniques to use. It is up to you to decide the best architecture.

Warning: We will review your code line-by-line. We expect clean, efficient, and logical code structures.

Bonus Challenge (Optional): Implement a "Compare Universities" feature where a user can select 2 universities and see them side-by-side in a modal.

Submission Guidelines

Code: A GitHub repository link(Public).

Live Demo: Deploy your assignment (Vercel/Netlify/etc.) and provide the live link.

Report: Attach your PDF report directly to the email (Google Drive links are optional).

Innovation: If you implemented any extra features or improvements not listed here, please mention them in your email. We reward creativity.

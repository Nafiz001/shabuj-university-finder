## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### Real-Time Search

Live search functionality with debounced URL updates:
- Searches across university name, city, and country
- Updates URL with `?search=` parameter
- Works seamlessly with all other filters
- Includes clear button for quick reset

### Server-Side Filtering

All filtering happens on the server using Next.js Server Components and API routes. The filtering logic is centralized in `lib/universities.ts` and can be easily adapted to work with a database.

```typescript
// Example filter parameters
{
  search: "Harvard",
  country: "Canada",
  minTuition: 30000,
  maxTuition: 50000,
  minRanking: 1,
  maxRanking: 100,
  scholarshipAvailable: true,
  sortBy: "ranking",
  order: "asc"
}
```

### SEO Optimization

Dynamic metadata generation based on active filters:

```typescript
export async function generateMetadata({ searchParams }: PageProps): Promise<Metadata> {
  // Generates context-aware titles and descriptions
  // Updates Open Graph tags for social sharing
}
```
```

### Compare Feature

Comprehensive comparison system featuring:
- **Material Design Cards**: Card-based layout with university avatars
- **Color-Coded Avatars**: Unique color palette for each university
- **Compact Single-View Design**: No scrolling required - everything fits in one view
- **Smart Value Detection**: Automatic "Best Value" badges for universities with superior ranking AND lower tuition
- **Material Icons**: Visual indicators for each metric (ranking, location, tuition, IELTS, etc.)
- **Dynamic Insights**: Real-time comparison analysis highlighting key differences
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts beautifully from mobile to desktop
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, smooth animations, and clear CTAs

### Material Design Implementation
- Google Material Icons integrated throughout the application
- Range slider for tuition fee filtering with real-time value display
- Card-based layout for university listings and comparisons
- Smooth animations with custom keyframe animations
- Dark mode support across all components
